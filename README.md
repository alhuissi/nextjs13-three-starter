# :japanese_castle: React-Three-Next starter

Added a navbar and other adjustments to the original repo: https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-next

A minimalist starter for NextJS, @react-three/fiber and Threejs.

This starter allows you to navigate seamlessly between pages with dynamic dom and/or canvas content without reloading or creating a new canvas every time. 3D components are usable anywhere in the dom. The events, dom, viewport, everything is synchronized!

### How to use

#### Installation

_Tailwind is the default style. styled-components (styled) are also available._

```sh
yarn create r3f-app next my-app
# yarn create r3f-app <next> my-app <tailwind|styled>? -ts?
```

### :passport_control: Typescript

For typescript add the parameter `-ts` or `--typescript`:

```sh
yarn create r3f-app next my-app -ts
```
